# DemoHibernate

Author: Dr. YUHANG ZHAO

Introduction: 
In this demo, we explore how to setup and use the ORM tool Hibernate which implements JPA.

Overview:
To setup Hibernate, we need: 
- dependencies for Hibernate and MySQL;
- the hibernate plugin (JBoss/hibernate) in Eclipse MarketPlace;
- the configuration of MySQL in hibernate.cfg.xml.
To use Hibernate, we:
- use "Session" which is an interface between the application and Hibernate;
- explore how to fetch object from and save object into DB;
- explore how to map object relations;
- use Hibernate Query Language (HQL) for complicated ORM manipulations,
  which differs to SQL in that HOL manipulates objects but SQL manipulates DB.
 
Future Work: Exploration of Hibernate caching.

System Configuration:
- Windows 7
- MySQL Workbench v8.0
- MySQL Connector 8.0.17
- Hibernate 5.4.2.Final
